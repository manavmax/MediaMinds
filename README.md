🌟 Overview

Welcome to the Media Minds! This project aims to provide valuable insights into social media post performance by analyzing engagement data (likes, shares, comments) across different post types like carousel posts, reels, and static images. The module integrates Langflow for intelligent insights generation and uses DataStax Astra DB for efficient data storage and querying.

Whether you're a social media manager or a data enthusiast, this module can help optimize social media strategies by analyzing engagement trends and providing actionable insights.
